# Epilepsy Detection for Single Channel EEG Signals with Machine Learning

---

Using machine learning techniques for epilepsy and seizure detection using machine learning. A vast feature engineering process is done on the single channel EEG signals. 

First,  statistical features are extracted from EEG signals in:

1. Time Domain
2. FFT Domain
3. Wavelet Domain
4. STFT Domain

Then, an SFFS feature selection process is performed to select the best features based on the feedback from the classifier to get the best performance with a minimum number of features.
